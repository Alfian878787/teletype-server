## Testing pull requests

Visit the [atom-teletype pipeline dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/pipelines/7b6e5b11-ca97-402a-8b3f-b48f2d1645cf) on Heroku.

In the left-hand column, you'll see a *review application* for each open pull request on this repository. Alternatively, you can also wait for a deployment notification to be displayed directly on the pull-request.

The teletype package can be instructed to use one of these servers by opening the package's settings page and assigning the base URL.

You'll need to reload the window for the change to take effect. You should not normally need to touch the Pusher key as we use the same Pusher account on both staging and production.

## Deploying

1. Ask @as-cii, @nathansobo, @jasonrudolph, or @iolsen to grant you deploy access on https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/atom-teletype.
